This is a cipher that was used by Julius Caesar two thousand years ago. The good news is that it is simple and easy to learn. The bad news is that because it is so simple, it is also easy for a cryptanalyst to break it. 
But we can use it just as a simple learning exercise. 
The Caesar Cipher is also explained on Wikipedia here :
